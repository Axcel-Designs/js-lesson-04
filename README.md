Task 1: Create a basic function
+	Declare a function named greet that logs a greeting message to the console.
+	Call the function to see the greeting message printed.

Task 2: Pass arguments to a function
+	Modify the greet function to accept a parameter representing a name.
+	Update the function body to include the name in the greeting message.
+	Call the function with different names as arguments.

Task 3: Return a value from a function
+	Create a function named multiply that takes two parameters representing numbers.
+	Multiply the two numbers inside the function and return the result.
+	Call the function and store the returned value in a variable.
+	Log the variable to the console to see the multiplication result.

Task 4: Use default parameter values
+	Modify the greet function to have a default parameter value of "Guest" for the name.
+	If no argument is passed when calling the function, it should use the default value.
+	Call the function both with and without passing a name argument.

Task 5: Create a function expression
+	Declare a function expression named add that adds two numbers.
+	Assign the function expression to a variable.
+	Call the function using the variable and log the result.

Task 6: Use arrow functions
+	Rewrite the greet function as an arrow function.
+	Test the arrow function by calling it with different names.

Task 7: Understand function scope
+	Create a variable inside a function and try to access it outside the function.
+	Declare a variable outside a function and try to access it inside the function.

Task 8: Use closure
+	Create a function that returns another function.
+	The inner function should have access to the variables defined in the outer function.
+	Call the outer function and store the returned inner function in a variable.
+	Call the inner function and observe that it still has access to the outer variables.

Task 9: Use immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)
+	Create an IIFE that performs a specific action immediately.
+	Write an IIFE that logs a message to the console when the page loads.
